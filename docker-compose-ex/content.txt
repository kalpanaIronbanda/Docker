Docker compose:
==============

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (usually named docker-compose.yml) to configure services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to manage complex applications

Docker-Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

Start, stop, and rebuild services
View the status of running services
Stream the log output of running services
Run a one-off command on a service

Sample example of docker compose file:

First of all we have to list out the all services to start with docker-compose
The default name of the docker-compose file is docker-compose.yaml

Docker-compose.yml 
====================

        version: '3'
        services:
        apache:
            build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: apache-Dockerfile
            ports:
            - "8002:80"

        static:
            build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: static-Dockerfile
            ports:
            - "8000:80"

This file will build the both images and run with single command docker-compose up
