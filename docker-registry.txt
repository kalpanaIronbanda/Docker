Docker Registry
---------------

A Docker Registry is a service that stores and distributes Docker container images. It acts as a centralized repository for Docker images, allowing users to push and pull container images to and from a common location.

By default docker interacts with dockerhub.

DockerHub is a hosted registry solution by Docker Inc.
Besides public and private repositories, it also provides:
automated builds,
integration with source control solutions like Github and Bitbucket etc.

But we have to use private registries for the images which are not for all

many cloud providers provides registries, if are using self-hosted registry we have to login first. 

        docker login <registry url>

        docker tag myimage:newimage

        docker push <imagename>:tag
        
        docker pull <imagename>:tag
